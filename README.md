In this tutorial, I was tasked to implement a basic user interface for a puzzle-platformer game using the Godot UI system. I implemented everything that was asked of the tutorial checklist including:
1. a main menu screen,
2. a stage select screen,
3. a Life indicator in the HUD, and
4. a game over screen

There was nothing of note during the implementation process, everything went smoothly without a hitch.
